# Tic-Tac-Toe

Simple paper-and-pencil game.

## To Do

- Split into functions (good naming, no side-effects)
- Split into modules
- Controls to select field size and victory condition
- Polish the code (good naming)
- Fix bugs (if there are)
- Maybe use Webpack ðŸ˜‚
- Slightly improve design (Change cursor icon depending on whose move is now)
- Maybe color cells after the victory
- Think about how AI could work
